Welcome to my site! For now, I've just listed some other places on the web I find interesting and/or important.

Besides from these, I plan on including a résumé & academic CV, portfolio & personal projects sections, a blog (which will talk about my projects, among other topics), and a brief informal biography.

# Animation Technology

### Websites
- [Physics Based Animation](https://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/)
    - [Methodology for Assessing Mesh-Based Contact Point Methods](https://www.physicsbasedanimation.com/2018/08/09/methodology-for-assessing-mesh-based-contact-point-methods/)
- [Albert Chern Teaching](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/teaching/)
    - Albert Chern teaches about computer graphics, and in particular physics simulation, at UCSD. Here he also includes his previous teaching at Caltech.
- [Physically Based Rendering](https://www.pbr-book.org/)
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
    - I don't know this web book well, but it was recommended by someone in my university's game development club
- [Disney Animation Publications](https://disneyanimation.com/publications/)
    - Also, [Disney Animation Studios](https://disneyanimation.com/) in general
- [cgbookcase](https://www.cgbookcase.com/) has free PBR textures and a few guides on physically-based rendering.
    - See also [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/), [Texture Box](https://texturebox.com/), and [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris) *(all diverse asset libraries)*, as well as [3D Textures](https://3dtextures.me/) *(more PBR textures)*

### Software
3D Animation
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
- [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/)
- [RenderMan](https://rmanwiki-27.pixar.com/space/REN27/542212717/RenderMan)

2D Animation
- [Moho](https://moho.lostmarble.com/)
    - Strict 30-day free trial, but Debut is inexpensive and even the full professional license is not too bad as far as animation software goes. Used for Wolfwalkers, most famously. Moho (whose creators are anti-AI) has especially nice rigging & effects systems, but they may be unsuitable for many animation styles.
- [OpenToonz](https://opentoonz.org/)
    - Well-known as the software modified by Studio Ghibli for their films. Great for traditional animators, especially those who want to scan from physical mediums.
- [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)
    - Krita is decent for digital art in general. Not primarily for animation, but it will do as a free solution.

# Game Development

### Software
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/wwise/overview/)
    - This is audio middleware for game developers; I also considered listing it under "Music"
- [Famitracker](https://famitracker.com/) *(Chiptune music sequencer)*
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) *(Pixel art & animation)*
    - Aseprite costs money to quick install, but if you can't afford this, you may compile from the source yourself for free.

# Music

### Websites
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
- [Synth Secrets](https://www.soundonsound.com/synthesizers/synth-secrets?f%5B0%5D=node%253Afield_section%3A6971)
- [SchenkerGUIDE](https://schenkerguide.com/)

### Software
- [Musescore](https://musescore.org/en)
- [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/)
    - If a visual interface is needed, consider [Frescobaldi](https://frescobaldi.org/) or [any of the other easier editing options given on the Lilypond site](https://lilypond.org/easier-editing.html)
- [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/)
    - I personally use Bitwig, but Reaper has an honor-system 30 day trial (the app continues to function after 30 days have passed, with a popup reminding the user to pay) and is generally a very good DAW
- [plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) 
    - Plugdata is an implementation of the puredata visual audio programming environment as a plugin to be used in any DAW. It also allows for exporting VSTs.
- [Vital Synth](https://forum.vital.audio/)
- [TX16Wx Software Sampler](https://www.tx16wx.com/)

# Humanities

### Websites
- [Gettysburg Digital Humanities Toolkit](https://dh.sites.gettysburg.edu/toolkit/tools/)
- [Digital Humanities Climate Coalition Toolkit](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/)
- [Rutgers University Libguides](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/)
- [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)

# Other STEAM

### Websites
- [MB Type](https://mbtype.com/bio.html)
    - Butterick writes about Racket and typography, and has created a publication system for these writings using Racket
- [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/)
    - This is made with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), a package for publishing web books with R markdown, which I've enjoyed using as well. Bookdown is also referenced in the context of online mathematics education on the blog of [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/tls/2018/blog-writing-a-math-ebook-part-1-choosing-an-authoring-tool/) (this is where I first learned about it).
